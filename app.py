Generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to create a fully responsive and visually appealing website for a business called {business_name} in the {niche} industry.
The website should have the following structure and features:
1. **Header**:
   - Includes the business name "{business_name}" prominently.
   - A navigation bar with links to sections like Home, About, Services, and Contact Us.
2. **Hero Section**:
   - A full-width section with a high-quality image or background video (you can just provide the HTML structure).
   - Include a headline summarizing the business's unique value proposition.
   - A call-to-action button (e.g., "Learn More" or "Contact Us").
3. **About Section**:
   - A section providing information about the business, its mission, and what it offers.
   - Use a simple, professional layout with text and images.
4. **Services Section**:
   - List the services the business provides in a grid format, with icons or images and short descriptions.
5. **Contact Us Section**:
   - A contact form with fields for name, email, subject, and message.
   - Display contact information, including phone number, email, and address.
6. **Footer**:
   - Social media links (icons with hover effects).
   - Copyright information and additional navigation links.

### Design Guidelines:
- Use the {theme} theme with {color_scheme} as the primary color scheme (be specific with colors if necessary).
- The layout should be responsive, adjusting to mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes smoothly.
- The font style should be modern and professional.
- Include CSS for hover effects, transitions, and any animations to improve the user experience.
- Ensure accessibility (use `aria-labels`, and alt-text for images).

### JavaScript:
- Use JavaScript to implement basic interactions, such as:
   - A smooth scrolling effect for navigation links.
   - Form validation for the contact form.
   - A mobile-friendly hamburger menu for the navigation bar on smaller screens.
